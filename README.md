Bin2Video Kaggle Notebook
This repository contains a Kaggle notebook (bin2video-kaggle.ipynb) that demonstrates how to use the bin2video application to encode and decode binary files into video format using FFmpeg with GPU acceleration. The notebook includes steps to set up the environment, encode a file into a video, decode the video back to a file, and test the integrity of the output.
Prerequisites

A Kaggle environment with GPU support (e.g., NVIDIA Tesla T4).
Internet access enabled in the Kaggle notebook settings.

Steps
1. Download and Set Up bin2video
The notebook downloads the bin2video application and makes it executable. It also installs FFmpeg, which is required for video encoding and decoding.
# Download Application
!wget -O bin2video https://github.com/kannoun/bin2video_kaggle/raw/refs/heads/main/bin2video
!chmod +x bin2video
# Install FFmpeg
!apt-get update -y
!apt install -y ffmpeg

2. Download Input File
The input file (v.zip) is downloaded from a provided URL for encoding.
# Download input file
!wget -O v.zip https://l.station307.com/Dgr6wLFVjuHKQKUec3DA5R/v.zip

3. Encode File to Video
The bin2video tool encodes the input file (v.zip) into a video file (output.mp4) using the NVIDIA hardware-accelerated H.264 codec (h264_nvenc) with specific encoding settings.
# Encoding with GPU acceleration
!./bin2video -e -s 4 -f 60 -i v.zip -o output.mp4 -- -c:v h264_nvenc -preset p6 -cq 23


-e: Encode mode.
-s 4: Set size parameter to 4.
-f 60: Set frame rate to 60 FPS.
-i v.zip: Input file.
-o output.mp4: Output video file.
-- -c:v h264_nvenc -preset p6 -cq 23: Use NVIDIA H.264 encoder with preset p6 and constant quality 23.

4. Decode Video to File
The encoded video (output.mp4) is decoded back to a file (t.7z) using the same NVIDIA H.264 codec settings.
# Decoding
!./bin2video -d -i output.mp4 -o t.7z -- -c:v h264_nvenc -preset p6 -cq 23


-d: Decode mode.
-i output.mp4: Input video file.
-o t.7z: Output file.
-- -c:v h264_nvenc -preset p6 -cq 23: Use NVIDIA H.264 encoder with preset p6 and constant quality 23.

5. Test Archive Integrity
The decoded archive (t.7z) is tested for integrity using the 7z command.
# Test archive
!7z t t.7z

Notes

The notebook uses GPU acceleration (h264_nvenc) to optimize encoding and decoding performance.
Ensure the input file URL is valid and accessible.
The commented-out option (-- -c:v hevc_nvenc -preset p6 -cq 25) in the encoding step suggests an alternative using the HEVC codec, but it is not used in this notebook.
The 7z command is used to verify the integrity of the decoded archive.

Usage
To run this notebook:

Clone this repository or import the notebook into a Kaggle environment.
Ensure GPU acceleration is enabled in the Kaggle notebook settings.
Execute the cells in sequence to download, encode, decode, and test the files.
